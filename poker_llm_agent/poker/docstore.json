) is one of the most popular variants of the card\ngame of poker . Two  cards, known as hole cards, are dealt face\ndown to each play er, and then five community cards  are dealt\nface up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three\ncards (\"the flop\"), later an additiona l single card (\"the turn\" or\n\"fourth street\"), and a final card (\"the river\" or \"fifth street\").\nEach player seeks the best five-card poker hand  from any\ncombination of the seven cards: the five community cards and\ntheir two hole cards. Players have betting  options to check, call,\nraise, or fold. Rou nds of betting take place before the flop is\ndealt and after each subsequent deal. The player who has the\nbest hand  and has not folded by the end of all betting rounds\nwins all of the money bet for the hand, known as the pot. In\ncertain situations, a \"split pot\" or \"tie\" can occur when two\nplayers have hands of equivalent value. This is also called\n\"chop the pot\". Texas hold 'em is also the H gam e featured in\nHORSE  and HOSE .\nIn Texas hold 'em, as in all variants of poker , individu als\ncompete for an amount of money or chips contributed by the\nplayers themselves (called the pot). Because the cards are dealt\nrandomly and outside the control of the players, each player\nattempts to control the amount of money in the pot based on\nthe hand  they  are holding,[1] and on their predi ction as to what\ntheir opponents may be holding and how they might behave.\nThe game is divide d into a series of hands (deals); at the conclusion of each hand, the pot is typically\nawarded to one player (an exceptio n in which the pot is divided between two or more is discussed\nbelow). A hand may end at the showdown , in which case the remaining players compare their hands\nand the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can\nbe held by more in the case of a tie. The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand occurs when all\nbut one player have folded  and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the pot is\nawarded to the player who has not folded.[1]\nThe objec tive of winning players is not to win every individual hand, but rather to win over the longer\nterm by making mathematically and psychologically better decisions regarding when and how much\nto bet, raise, call or fold.

The game becam e popular and quickly\nspread to the Golden Nugget , Stardust  and Dunes .[3] In 1967,\na group of Texan gamblers and card players, including\nCrandell Addingto n, Doyle Brunson , and Amarillo Slim  were\nplaying in Las Vegas. This is when \"ace high\" was changed\nfrom the original form in which aces were low.[4] Addington\nsaid the first time he saw the game was in 1959. \"They didn't\ncall it Texas hold 'em at the time, they just called it hold 'em.\u2026\nI thought then that if it were to catch on, it would become the\ngame. Draw poker , you bet only twice; hold 'em, you bet four\ntimes. That meant you could play strategically. This was more\nof a thinking man's game.\"[5]\nFor several years the Golden Nugget Casino in Downtown Las Vegas  was the only casin o in Las Vegas\nto offer the game. At that time, the Golden Nugget's poker room was \"truly a 'sawdust  joint,' with\u2026\noiled sawdust covering the floors.\"[6] Because of its location and decor, this poker room did not\nreceive many rich drop-in clients, and as a result, professional players sought a more prominent\nlocation. In 1969, the Las Vegas professionals were invited to play Texas hold 'em at the entrance of\nthe now-demolish ed Dunes Casino on the Las Vegas Strip . This prominent location, and the relative\ninexperience of poker players with Texas hold 'em, resulted in a very remunerative game for\nprofessional players.[6]\nAfter a failed attempt to establish a \"Gambling Fraternity Convention\" , Tom Moore added the first\never poker tournament to the Second Annual Gambling Fraternity Convention held in 1969. This\ntournament featured several games, including Texas hold 'em. In 1970, Benny  and Jack Binion\nacquired the rights to this conventio n, renamed it the World Series of Poker , and moved it to their\ncasino, Binion's Horseshoe , in Las Vegas. After its first year, a journalist, Tom Thackrey, suggested\nthat the main event of this tournament should be no-limit  Texas hold 'em. The Binions agreed and\never since no-limit Texas hold 'em has been played as the main event.[6] Interest in the main event\ncontinued to grow steadily over the next two decades.

Alvarez's\nbook is credited with beginning the genre of poker literature and with bringing Texas hold 'em (and\npoker generally) to a wider audien ce.[13] Alvarez's book was not the first book about poker. The\nEducation of a Poker Player , by Herbert Yardley , a former U.S. government code breaker, was\npublished in 1957.\nInterest in hold 'em outside of Nevada  bega n to grow in the 1980s as well. Although California  had\nlegal card rooms offering draw poker , Texas hold 'em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute\nthat made illegal the (now unheard of) game \"stud-horse \". But in 1988 Texas hold 'em was declared\nlegally distinct from stud-horse in Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp ,[14] and declared to be a game of skill.[15]\nAlmost immediate ly card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em.[16] It is often presum ed that\nthis decis ion ruled that hold 'em was a game of skill ,[17] but the distinction between skill and chance\nhas never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker.[18]\nAfter a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers Terry Rogers and Liam Flood  introduced the game to European\ncard players in the early 1980s.\nTexas hold 'em is now one of the most popular forms of poker.[19][20] Texas hold 'em's popularity\nsurged in the 2000s due to exposur e on television, the Internet and popular literature. During this\ntime hold 'em replaced seven-card stud  as the most comm on game in U.S. casinos.[21] The no-limit\nbetting  form is used in the widely televised main event of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and the\nWorld Poker Tour  (WPT).\nHold 'em's simplicity and popularity have inspired a wide variety of strategy books that provide\nrecommendations for proper play. Most of these books recommend a strategy that involves playing\nrelatively few hands but betting and raising often with the hands one plays.[22] In the first decade of\nthe twenty-first century, Texas hold 'em experienced a surge in popularity worldwide.[21] Many\nobservers attribute this growth to the synergy of five factors: the invention of online poker , the game's\nappearance in film and on televisio n, invention and usage of the \"hole card cam\" (which allowed\nviewers to see hole cards played in the hand as a means of determining strategy and decision-making\nduring gameplay),  the appearance of television commercials advertisin g online cardrooms, and the\n2003 World Series of Poker  championship victory by online qualifier Chris Moneymaker .[23]\nPrior to poker becoming widely televised, the movie Rounders  (1998), starring Matt Damon  and\nEdward Norton , gave moviegoers a romantic view  of the game as a way of life desp ite the poker\nportrayed being often criticized by more serious players.  Texas hold 'em was the main game played\nduring the movie and the no-limit variety was described, following Doyle  Brunson, as the \"Cadillac of\nPoker\".

A dealer button  is\nused to represent the player in the dealer\nposition; the dealer button rotate s clockwise\nafter each  hand, changing the position of the\ndealer and blinds. The small blind  is posted by\nthe playe r to the left of the dealer and is usually\nequal to half of the big blind.

Limi t hold 'em has historically been the most popular form of hold 'em found in casino live action\ngames in the United States.[21] In limit hold 'em, bets and raises during the first two rounds of betting\n(pre-flop and flop) must be equal to the big blind; this amount is called the small bet. In the next two\nrounds of betting (turn and river), bets and raises must be equal to twice the big blind; this amount is\ncalled the big bet .\nNo-limit hold 'em has grown in popularity and is the form most commonly found in televised\ntournament poker  and is the game played in the main event of the Worl d Series of Poker. In no-limit\nhold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up to all of the chips the player\nhas at the table (called an all-in  bet). The minimu m raise is equal to the size of the previous bet or\nraise. If someone wishes to re-raise , they must raise at least the amou nt of the previous raise. For\nexample, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6\nmore for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise\n(or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other\nplayers also still in the game). In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size of the pot\n(including the amount needed to call).\nSome casinos that offer hold 'em also allow the player to the left of the big blind to post an optional\nlive straddle , usually double the amount of the big blind. This causes that player to act as the big blind\nand the player has an option to raise when it comes to their turn again . (Some variations allow for\nstraddle on the button). No-limit games may also allow multiple re-st raddles, in any amount that\nwould be a legal raise.[10]\nFollowing a shuffle of the cards, play  begins with each player being\ndealt two cards  face down, with the player in the small blind\nreceiving the first card and the player in the button seat receiving\nthe last card dealt.  (As in most poker games, the deck is a standard\n52-card deck containing no jokers .) These cards are the players'\nhole  or pocket  cards. These are the only cards each player will\nreceive individually, and they will (possibly) be revealed only at\nthe showdown , making Texas hold 'em a closed  poker game.\nThe hand  begins with a \"pre-flop\" betting round, beginning with\nthe player to the left of the big blind (or the player to the left of the\ndealer, if no blinds are used) and continuing clockwise. A round of\nbetting continues until every player has folded, put in all of their\nchips, or matched the amount put in by all other active players. See betting  for a detailed account.\nNote that the blinds are considered \"live\" in the pre-flop betting round, meaning that they are counted\ntoward the amoun t that the blind player must contribute. If all players call around to the player in the\nbig blind position, that player may either check or raise.\nAfter the pre-flop betting round, assuming there remain at least two players taking part in the hand,\nthe dealer deals a flop: three face-up community cards .

If two or more players remain after the final betting round, a\nshowdown  occurs. On the showdown, each player plays the best poker hand  they can make from the\nseven cards compr ising their two hole cards and the five community cards. A player may use both of\ntheir own two hole cards, only one, or none at all, to form their final five-card hand. If the five\ncommunity cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be playing the board  and can\nonly hope to split  the pot, because each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the\nsame hand.[10]\nIf the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any\nextra chip s going to the first players after the button in clockwise order.

A kicker is a card that is part of the five-card poker hand,\nbut is not used in determining a hand's rank .

This strategy\ninvolves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often with those that one does\nplay (agg ressive).[22] Althoug h this strategy is often recommended, some professional players\nsuccessfully employ other strategies as well.[22]\nAlmost all authors agree that where a player sits in the order of play (known as position ) is an\nimportant element of Texas hold 'em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold'em.[1] Play ers who act later\nhave more information than players who act earlier. As a result, playe rs typically play fewer hands\nfrom early positions than later positions.\nBecause of the game's level of compl exity, it has received some attention from academics. One attempt\nto develop a quantitative model of a Texas hold'em tournament as an isolated complex system has had\nsome success,[44] although the full consequences for optimal strategies remain to be explored. In\naddition, groups at the University of Alberta  and Carnegie Mellon University  worked to develop poker\nplaying programs utilizing techniqu es in game theory and artificial intelligence .[45][46] In Janu ary\n2015, the AAAS  journal Science  reported that the group at the University of Alberta  had succeeded in\ncoding a computer  program called Cepheus  that can learn from its playing expe rience to optimize its\nCFR  algorithm  and approach playing perfection when opposing strong players in the variant known as\nheads-up limit Texas Hold 'em, which involves only two players. Although it does not win every hand,\nit is unbeatable on average over a large number of hands. The program exhibits more variation in its\ntactics than professional players do, for instance bluffing with weak hands that professional players\ntend to fold.[47][48][49] Public web access to observe and play against Cepheus is available.[50]\nBecause only two cards are dealt to each player, it is easy to character ize all of the starting hands.\nThere are (52 \u00d7 51)/2 = 1,326 distinct possible combinations  of two cards from a standard 52-card\ndeck. Because no suit is more powerful than another , man y of these can be equated for the analysis of\nstarting-hand strategy. For example, although J \u2665 J \u2663 and J \u2666 J \u2660 are distinct combi nations of cards by\nrank and suit, they are of equal value as starting hands.\nBecause of this equivalence, there are only 169 effectively different hole-card combinations. Thirteen\nof these are pairs, from deuces (twos) to aces. There are 78 ways to have two cards of different rank\n(12 possible hands containing one ace, 11 possible hands containing one king but no ace, 10 possible\nhands containing one queen but no ace or king, etc.). Both hole cards can be used in a flush  if they are\nsuited, but pairs are never suited, so there would be 13 possible pairs, 78 possible suited non-pairs,Strategy\nStarting hands", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3686, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b95540d-a674-4bcc-ac27-dc08431d11b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b95540d-a674-4bcc-ac27-dc08431d11b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "poker_wiki.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24f903f6-cc28-4718-b181-87438c267838", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "poker_wiki.pdf"}, "hash": "2c3a51b8ae3e163460780eba1a01ebab6e02a47049336198c2642bd0e8f3273f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4057ca7-5186-4483-924a-724e06dee375", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "poker_wiki.pdf"}, "hash": "deb62fab15be786f784509fd00b1dac70f05b27ee5d624f0d75c1ec3a60fe986", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7a832237-c9f3-4b10-9c98-c69ee8605b71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3efbff4744ce59d33edc7f95625f0fe0324e182071232c9a574a8106020f792a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4/9/24, 1:25 PM Texas hold 'em - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em 13/20\nA pair of aces is statistically the best\nhand to be dealt in Texas hold 'em\npoker.and 78 possible unsuited (\"off-suit\") non-pairs, for a total of 169\npossible hands.[51] Suited starting hands are stronger than their\nunsuited counterparts, although the magnitude of this strength\nadvantage in different games is debated.[52]\nBecause of the limited number of starting hands, most strategy\nguides include a detailed discussion of each of them. This\ndistinguishes hold 'em from other poker games where the\nnumber of starting card combinations forces strategy guides to\ngroup hands into broad categories. Another result of this small\nnumber is the proliferation of colloquial names for individual\nhands .\nTexas Hold'em is commonly played both as a \"cash\" or \"ring\" game  and as a tournament game .\nStrategy for these different forms can vary.\nBefore the advent of poker tournaments , all poke r games were played with real money where players\nbet actua l currency (or chips that represented currency). Games that feature wagering actual money\non individual hands are still very common and are referred to as \"cash games\" or \"ring games\".\nThe no-limit  and fixed-limit  cash-game versions of hold 'em are strategically very different. Doyle\nBrunson claims that \"the games are so different that there are not many players who  rank with the\nbest in both types of hold 'em. Many no-limit players have difficulty gearing down  for limit, while\nlimit players often lack the courage and 'feel' necessary to excel at no-limit.\"[10] Because the size of\nbets is restricted in limit games, the ability to bluff  is somew hat curtailed. Because one is not (usually)\nrisking all of one's chips in limit poker, players are sometimes advised to take more chances.[10]\nLower-stakes gam es also exhibit different properties than higher-stake s games. Small-stakes games\noften involve more players in each  hand and can vary from extremely passive (little raising and\nbetting) to extrem ely aggressive (many raises). This difference of small -stakes games has prompted\nseveral books dedicated to only those games.[53]\nTexas hold 'em is often associated with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main\nevent in many of the famous tournaments, including the World Series of Poker 's Main Event, and is\nthe most common tournament overa ll.[54] Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with chips  that\nrepresent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to \"buy-in\" for a fixed\namount and all players begin with an equal value of chips.

As a result, the strate gy in poker tournaments can\nbe very different from a cash game.\nProper strategy in tournaments can vary widely depending on the amount of chips one has, the stage\nof the tournament , the amount of chips others have, and the playing styles of one's opponents.[22]\nAlthough some authors still recommend a tight playing style, others recommend looser play (playing\nmore hands) in tournaments than one would otherwise play in cash games. In tournaments the blinds\nand antes increase regularly, and can become much larger near the end of the tournament. This can\nforce players to play hands that they would not normally play when the blinds were small, which can\nwarrant both more loose and more aggressive play.[56]\nOne of the most important things in Texas hold'em is knowing how to evaluate a hand. The strategy of\nplaying each hand can be very different according to the strength of the hand. For example, on a\nstrong hand, a player might want to try to appear weak in order to not scare off other players with\nweaker hands, while on a weak hand, a player might try to bluff other players into folding.\nThere are several ways to evaluate hand strength; two of the most common are counting outs  and\nusing calculators.\nThis method consists of counting the cards still in the deck, which in combination with the cards the\nplayer already has can give the player a potentially winning hand. Such cards are called \"outs\", and\nhand strength can be measured by how many outs are still in the deck (if there are many outs then the\nprobability to get one of them is high and therefore the hand is strong). The following chart[57]\ndetermines the probability of hitting outs (bettering the player's hand) based on how many cards are\nleft in the deck and the draw type.Evaluating a hand\nCounting outs", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2162, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55d2f8cc-68f4-4223-b71b-4b2441552c51": {"__data__": {"id_": "55d2f8cc-68f4-4223-b71b-4b2441552c51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "poker_wiki.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e63b32e4-fc01-4504-b86a-fd326a9e4b7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "poker_wiki.pdf"}, "hash": "4ca684554530a558c3111ddbb4383e85f3e4e1b3e5f8fc1a72efe399b736ff01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7a832237-c9f3-4b10-9c98-c69ee8605b71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "poker_wiki.pdf"}, "hash": "d8ca0e88eec25ba7997d8f2bf5ef07e36c5c914d8e03d94513c72c62a8bade43", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5c09f08-0ee6-4760-9bef-a15e37495ca3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c0d8abe70ba17ed57aece6954de83a7dca92387d8f914418ce9be93c36669417", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4/9/24, 1:25 PM Texas hold 'em - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em 15/20OutsOne\nCard\u00a0%Two\nCard\u00a0%One Card\nOddsTwo Card\nOddsDraw Type\n1 2% 4% 46 23 Inside Straight Flush\n2 4% 8% 22 12 Pocket Pair to Set\n3 7% 13% 14 7 One Overcard\n4 9% 17% 10 5 Inside Straight / Two Pair to Full House\n5 11% 20% 8 4 One Pair to Two Pair or Trips\n6 13% 24% 6.7 3.2 No Pair to Pair / Two Overcards\n7 15% 28% 5.6 2.6 Inside Straight & One Overcard\n8 17% 32% 4.7 2.2 Open Straight\n9 19% 35% 4.1 1.9 Flush\n10 22% 38% 3.6 1.6 Inside Straight & Two Overcards\n11 24% 42% 3.2 1.4 Open Straight & One Overcard\n12 26% 45% 2.8 1.2 Flush & Inside Straight / Flush & One Overcard\n13 28% 48% 2.5 1.1\n14 30% 51% 2.3 0.95 Open Straight & Two Overcards\n15 33% 54% 2.1 0.85Flush & Two Overcards / Flush & Open Ended Straight\n/ Flush & Inside Straight & One Overcard\n16 34% 57% 1.9 0.75\n17 37% 60% 1.7 0.66\nMultiplying the number of outs by two or four (the Two Times Rule or Four Times Rule) gives a\nreasonable approximation to the One Card\u00a0 % or Two Card\u00a0 %, respectively, in the above table.[58] For\nexample, an open straight draw on the flop has 8 outs so the odds to hit the straight on the turn is 16%\n(8 x 2) and the odds on the river is 32% (8 x 4).\nCalculators are poker tools that calculate the odds of a hand (combined with the cards on the table if\nthere are any) to win the game. Calculators provide precise odds but they  cannot be used in live games\nand are therefore mostly used on Internet poker games. The first known commercial poker calculator\nwas marketed by Mike Caro. Michael Shackleford, the Wizard of Odds, later made one available to the\npublic free of charge on his website.[59]\nThere are several other poker variants that resemble Texas hold 'em. Hold 'em is a member of a class\nof poker games known as community card games , where some card s are available for use by all the\nplayers. There are several other games that use five community cards in addition to some private\ncards and are thus  like Texas hold 'em.
