At this stage, both you and your opponents have now seen 5 out of the 7 cards that go towards making your final hands.\n\nCarefully analyse the 3 community cards that are on the table, and the kind of questions you should be thinking about are as follows:\n\n1. How does the flop help my hand?\nWe\u2019ve discussed previously about what we are looking for on the flop with each of the different categories of starting hands, has the Flop come up with what we want?\n\n2. Has the Flop helped my Opponent?\nWe\u2019re also trying to put our opponents on a type of hand by watching their actions and betting patterns, so ask yourself if it is likely that the flop has helped our opponent based on what hands or range of hands we think they might hold?\n\n3. What Draws are on the Flop?\nIt\u2019s important to recognise the potential draws that are on the board and consider how dangerous a flop it was:\n\nFlush Draw \u2013 Is there a Flush possibility on the flop? ie: if there is 3 cards of the same suit on the flop then someone could have already hit a Flush, if there are 2 cards of the same suit on the flop then someone could have a Flush draw.\nStraight Draw \u2013 are all the flop cards close together to give the chance of an opponent holding a straight, or be drawing towards a straight?\nWhenever you think your opponent is on a draw (ie: he needs one more card to complete his hand) then you must make him pay to see more cards, it is very bad strategy to let him have a free card. The only situation where you would maybe do this is if you have an even stronger hand than the one you think your opponent is drawing to and you want your opponent to hit his hand so that you can extract more money from him.\n\n4. Is there a board pair on the flop\nBe very wary of a flop which pairs the board, e.g. Adiamonds 8spades Aclubs, this kind of flop opens up a lot of possibilities of strong hands such as three of a kind, or a full house or even four of a kind on rare occasions.\n\nOften other players are also just as wary of this kind of flop, so the first person to bet into a pot like this, quite often forces everyone to fold and takes the pot, so by all means have an attempt to take the pot, but if you are raised or your opponents indicates any kind of strength get out of there, unless you have a hand that can compete!\n\n5. Are you in front?\nSo after considering all of the above, you should be in a better position to understand what is going on and your position in the hand. Are you likely to be in the lead after the flop with the best hand? Are your opponents drawing to a better hand that you need to protect against? Maybe your hand is very weak compared to hands you think your opponent may hold and it is best to give up on this hand and save any further loss.\n\nIf you decide that you are in the lead after the flop, then you should make your opponents pay to see more cards, don\u2019t give them free cards for them to hit a hand which could overtake you.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3128, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69948af0-5eb7-4973-9b4d-fef66c68446a": {"__data__": {"id_": "69948af0-5eb7-4973-9b4d-fef66c68446a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide2.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6797, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0506993b-cca1-4502-8f26-74dd1d5bcc65", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide2.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6797, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "6ca995b4beba12d7dbcd76fd40329a8e31a5b767734c93bf358095fd28a21748", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35e9be1f-201e-49b7-91e1-f8ece470b47d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide1.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide1.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 3140, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "d4c4280525879946b388f120931f4bb41823017f6d198cd8308bcb149138c7ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7345b9be-84e9-42f8-91c2-6fcdf7c8cbeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce0512184c97fa70e17b0f4ed8f51840743da03bddd11aef9e7c1f8568d56263", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There are four distinct parts to a Texas Hold'em hand: preflop, the flop, the turn, and the river. The flop is the most important of the four because it almost always defines how the hand progresses. Three of the five community cards come into play on the flop, and it is your first chance to make your best five-card poker hand.\n\nMost poker players, even those relatively new to Texas Hold'em, have the preflop round figured out. They have starting hand selection down to a tee, but many seem clueless when the dealer spreads the all-important flop. They do not know whether or not to fire a continuation bet, check-call, check-raise, or what to do if an opponent leads into them (which is known as a \"donk bet\"). You will not be one of those players by the time you reach the end of this article about the flop.\n\nWhen a Texas Hold'em hand reaches the flop, there are several factors to consider. They include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe preflop betting action\n\nYour position at the table\n\nYour opponents' playing style and tendencies\n\nPlayers' stack sizes\n\nThe texture of the flop\n\nYou need to assess the preflop betting round before considering the best move on the flop. Hopefully, after reading and digesting our website's PartyPoker How to Play section, you will be the preflop aggressor because you know that raising or three-betting preflop gives you the momentum going into the hand. Do not worry if not, because we are covering that, too.\n\nReaching the flop after raising preflop gives you a range advantage because your opponents will give you credit for having a strong hand; plus, it opens the door to making a continuation bet, a powerful tool that too many players underutilize.\n\nMost flop play in Texas Hold'em boils down to three key questions:\n\nShould I make a continuation-bet\n\nShould I check-call\n\nShould I check-raise\n\nLet us take a look at each of those flop questions.\n\n \n\nWhen to Make a Continuation Bet on the Flop\nA continuation bet is a powerful move made by the preflop aggressor. You raise preflop, an opponent calls, and then you make a bet when first to act on the flop; this is a continuation bet. Continuation bets, or c-bets, often end the hand there and then, leaving you to pick up a small pot.\n\nAlthough you will miss the flop approximately two out of three times, a continuation bet screams that you are either still happy with your starting hand or that hand has improved further, and you are keen to build a pot with your strong hand. It should now be evident that a c-bet is a profitable weapon for a Hold'em player.\n\nYou should c-bet between 40-65% of the time you reach the flop after being the preflop aggressor. Continuation bets are made for two reasons: for value and as a bluff.\n\nC-betting for value is easy because you want to build a pot with your strong hand. It makes sense to c-bet if you raised preflop with Kc-Kh, your opponent called, and the flop fell Ks-9d-4h because you have top set and are in a great position to win the pot. You would also likely continuation bet with Kc-Kh on a Qd-Ts-6c flop because you have an overpair to the board.\n\nYou should not only c-bet when you have a strong hand because c-bets work great as bluffs. For example, you raise with Kc-Qc from the button, the big blind calls and the flop falls Ac-7d-5s. Your opponent checks to you; what is your play? This scenario is prime for a c-bet because the villain has not indicated any strength, but you have. You can c-bet and represent the ace despite only having king-high right now.\n\nYour opponent will likely fold some hands that beat you, such as pocket deuces, threes, fours, and maybe sixes. They may even fold if they hit the five or seven and almost certainly let their hand go if they called you with a hand like Kx-Tx, Qx-Jx, or similar. Their folding in this spot is a great result.\n\nOpponents that fold too much to a c-bet are perfect for attacking whenever you are in a pot with them. You should lessen your bluff c-betting frequency and bet more for value against foes that are calling stations and call with any piece of the board or draws.\n\n \n\nWhen Should I Check-Call or Check Behind on the Flop?\nSometimes, it is best to avoid making a continuation-bet and to check behind when your opponent checks to you.

You should lessen your bluff c-betting frequency and bet more for value against foes that are calling stations and call with any piece of the board or draws.\n\n \n\nWhen Should I Check-Call or Check Behind on the Flop?\nSometimes, it is best to avoid making a continuation-bet and to check behind when your opponent checks to you. This is usually when your hand is super strong or ridiculously weak. For example, you raise on the button with As-Ac, the big blind calls, then checks to you on an Ad-4c-4d flop. You have flopped a full house and have the board tied up. Your opponent is highly unlikely to have an ace or a four, so will almost always fold to a c-bet. As you want to maximize the value of your top-tier hands, checking behind here and hoping your opponent either picks up a draw, improves their hand, or bluffs at the turn is a good option.\n\nConversely, you raise with 9c-9d from the cutoff, the button and both blinds call, and the flop falls Ks-Qs-8c. The blinds check to you; what is your play? Checking behind is probably best here because there are two overcards to your pair, there are possible straight and flush draws out there, the button is yet to act, and you are facing multiple opponents. You could have the best hand right now, but so many turn cards hurt your chances of winning. Also, the button could raise with a hand like Jc-8c, and you have to fold the best hand.\n\n \n\nWhen Should I Check-Raise the Flop?\nYou will sometimes find yourself on the flop out of position, having either called a raise or having raised preflop and then called a three-bet. It is not ideal, but you still have some potential moves up your sleeve.\n\nSome opponents are perfect for check-raising against. A villain that raises and re-raises preflop and then continuously makes a continuation bet is your prime target, especially if they tend to fold after someone plays back at them.\n\nCheck-raising a flop that you have a strong draw on is another potential spot. Playing draws fast can be a good move because your opponent may fold there and then or may call, and the pot builds for when you do hit your draw. Furthermore, playing a draw fast disguises your hand because many players check-call when chasing a flush or straight, so they will not think you are drawing.\n\nMore check-raising opportunities present themselves if you call a late position raise from the big blind. Imagine the button raising, you calling in the big blind, and the flop falling Qs-4c-3d. You check, and your opponent makes a half-pot continuation bet. You should consider a check-raise here regardless of your holding. Your opponent has a massive range of hands, but your check-raise here screams that you have flopped two pairs with 4x-3x, a set of threes or fours. Unless your opponent has aces, kings, or a strong queen, they will be in a world of pain if you check-raise them here.", "start_char_idx": 3520, "end_char_idx": 6797, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af166786-0a66-4ea5-b580-cf27316f3d83": {"__data__": {"id_": "af166786-0a66-4ea5-b580-cf27316f3d83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58552be-07ba-4c3c-9860-287cec9e7a37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3c7263204fff448f9b4bf79bdf074a8a7375d5db25626bdcbaba8c1d082bfeee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7345b9be-84e9-42f8-91c2-6fcdf7c8cbeb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide2.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide2.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 6797, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "99add84c7ac79360e2c01698acf2d94c57da84782dc1266dc188525a7f8b4e95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "704a0a27-9a8b-41c1-a17b-b559cde43dc8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2c53ff4a82a03f88a1454df45a5dda5f1af875888ffb8e8ab72be2bc8608c8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The flop is a critical juncture in any game of Texas Hold'em. It's the point in the hand where players gain valuable information about their hand strength and must make important decisions about whether to continue playing or fold.\na dealer laying down the flop\nTHE FLOP\nAfter you\u2019ve navigated the preflop betting round, the first three community cards, called the flop, are dealt. At this point in the hand, you start to get an idea of how strong your hand is and how it could impact your opponent\u2019s hand.\n\nIdentifying which flops are good for your range and, subsequently, your opponents, enables you to make better decisions on the flop and later streets. In this guide, we\u2019ll look at how to categorize flops, what decisions you should make based on your hand strength, and tips to help you improve your flop play.\n\nWHAT IS THE FLOP?\nThe flop is the second betting round, where three cards are dealt face-up after the first betting round. These three cards will dictate your hand and the rest of the round.\n\nThere are many successful pre-flop strategies, but many post-flop strategies, too. Let\u2019s run through the various plays you should remember when betting post-flop.\n\nTHE FLOP RESULTS\nOnce the three cards are dealt, you must decide how to approach the round. Here are some questions you should be asking once the first cards are laid:\n\nThe first question; have the cards improved your hand and put you in a position of power? Alternatively, perhaps the cards haven\u2019t improved your hand, and the best course of action is to fold and wait for a better opportunity.\nThe second question you should ask is whether there is a straight or flush draw.\nSTRAIGHT DRAW:\nA straight draw is four of the five cards needed to make a straight, which is the hand that contains five cards of sequential rank but not of the same suit.\n\nFLUSH DRAW:\nThis is four of the five cards needed to make a flush, which is five cards of the same suit.\n\nAs soon as the flop is out, you need to understand your drawing possibilities. If you have a good chance of hitting a straight or a flush, you want to get there as cheaply as possible. So you need to consider your chances and bet accordingly. If you\u2019re facing a hefty raise, think twice before betting again; if there\u2019s no raise, you\u2019re in a great position to draw to that stronger hand.\n\nIf you\u2019re on a straight or a flush draw, consider making a slight raise to stop your opponent from taking control of the betting with a marginal hand. Even if they call your raise, you\u2019re still in a good position. Once you hit your straight or flush, you should raise again. Obviously, you need to consider the action at the table and if an opponent could have a stronger or similar hand.\n\nCATEGORIZING THE FLOP\nWhen you hear people talking about flops, you may hear them talking about the \u201cboard texture.\u201d They are referring to how the communal cards on the flop interact with each other, and there are several different words we use to categorize them:\n\nDry/Static \u2013 The cards aren\u2019t close together in terms of rank and aren\u2019t the same suit, meaning there aren\u2019t many draws on the board: K\u26638\u26603\u2666\ufe0f\nWet/Dynamic \u2013 The cards are close together, and there are at least two cards of the same suit, meaning there are a lot of draws on the board: 9\u26608\u2660J\u2663\nPaired \u2013 Two of the cards on the flop are of the same rank: A\u2663A\u2666\ufe0f9\u2660\nTwo-tone \u2013 Two of the cards on the flop are the same suit, but the cards aren\u2019t necessarily close together: A\u26609\u26605\u2666\ufe0f\nMonotone \u2013 All three cards are the same suit, but the cards aren\u2019t necessarily close together: Q\u2764\ufe0f8\u2764\ufe0f5\u2764\ufe0f\nConnected \u2013 The cards are close together in terms of rank but aren\u2019t necessarily the same suits: 4\u26636\u2666\ufe0f7\u2660\nAs you can see, some of the definitions overlap somewhat, such as \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cconnected.\u201d You\u2019ll find that most people just use \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d to describe flops, so as long as you know the differences between those, you\u2019ll be fine.\n\nPOST-FLOP HANDS\nOnce the flop has been dealt, one of the first things we should do is look at how it impacts our hand.\n\nOur post-flop hand strength is one of the major factors in deciding what action to take. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial that you have a good understanding of where your hand falls within these three categories:\n\n1.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4221, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "704a0a27-9a8b-41c1-a17b-b559cde43dc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "704a0a27-9a8b-41c1-a17b-b559cde43dc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58552be-07ba-4c3c-9860-287cec9e7a37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3c7263204fff448f9b4bf79bdf074a8a7375d5db25626bdcbaba8c1d082bfeee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af166786-0a66-4ea5-b580-cf27316f3d83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "0548d940392241ce52180d86c42ff33d92cb4c84086e36aa63ae30e64314b457", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30a880b9-042a-45e5-b15f-4ff15b88e741", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8f1ced6e36fc911c9a1028e9da106701bcdd40cd3bf989addc1ea234dbe6c9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "POST-FLOP HANDS\nOnce the flop has been dealt, one of the first things we should do is look at how it impacts our hand.\n\nOur post-flop hand strength is one of the major factors in deciding what action to take. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial that you have a good understanding of where your hand falls within these three categories:\n\n1. MADE HANDS\nThe first category we\u2019ll look at is \u201cmade hands.\u201d In these situations, your hand has flopped a decent or significant amount of equity and is strong enough to continue against a bet from your opponent. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the type of made hands you can have on the flop.\n\nMonster Hands \u2013 These are the hands everyone\u2019s hoping to make on the flop. With a monster hand, you often have the nuts or close to it, and it\u2019s unlikely that your hand will be beaten by the river. Examples of monster hands include flopping the nut flush, a full house, or quads.\nVery Strong Hands \u2013 These are hands where you feel good about your winning prospects. However, your hand is still vulnerable to some of the stronger hands out there. While there\u2019s a good chance your hand will be best by the river, it\u2019s not as much of a lock as the \u201cmonster hands\u201d section. Examples of a very strong hand are a set, two pair, an overpair, or top-pair top-kicker.\nMarginal Hands \u2013 Marginal hands are arguably the lowest-value hand you can make in poker. They\u2019re better than flopping nothing, but they\u2019re not likely to be good by the river and are best used as bluff catchers against aggressive opponents. Examples of marginal hands include bottom pair, middle pair, and pocket pairs below top pair.\nDrawing Hands \u2013 While drawing hands are technically worse than marginal hands (marginal hands at least have a pair), they have the potential to make strong hands. You\u2019ll often see that a strong draw, like a flush draw, has 30% equity against your opponent\u2019s range. When you make your hand, it\u2019s often the best hand, which is why they have expected value.\nHOW TO PLAY MADE HANDS\nAs there are several different made hands that you can have, learning how to play them can be tricky. The best way to learn is to take the time to consider each important variable before making your decision.\n\nIf you think through each of these and how it applies to the hand, the action you need to take should become clear. Here are the three most important things to consider when playing a made hand on the flop.\n\nThe Strength of Your Hand\nThe first thing you should look at is the strength of your hand. Generally, the better your hand is, the more often you should bet. This is because you want to build a pot when you have a strong hand to get as much value from your opponents as possible.\n\nHowever, as we\u2019ve seen above, not all made hands are strong enough to be bet for value. Therefore, if you have one of the marginal hands, sometimes the best play is to check and keep the pot small.\n\nThe Strength of Your Opponent\u2019s Range\nThe next thing to consider is the strength of your opponent\u2019s range. It doesn\u2019t matter how strong your hand is; if your opponent doesn\u2019t have a hand to call you with, you won\u2019t make any money! This is why you should always collectively consider the strength of your hand and your opponent\u2019s range.\n\nFor example, if you have a monster hand that\u2019s almost certain to win, but your opponent has a weak range, why would you bet, knowing that they\u2019re going to fold most of the time? Instead, a better option may be to check and hope they improve to a marginally worse hand than yours. Hell, maybe they get frisky and decide to bluff at the pot!\n\nThe Playing Style of Your Opponent\nAnother critical factor in deciding how to play your hand is your opponent\u2019s playing style. Some people play in such a way that you should dramatically adjust your strategy to try and exploit them. One of the best examples of this is the \u201cmaniac\u201d player.\n\nThese players will barrel off for three streets with absolute air in almost every hand as they try and bully the table. Now, if you have a strong hand that you would often bet, the best option may be to slowplay when you\u2019re up against one of these maniacs. By slowplaying, you allow your opponent to bluff into you, giving you three extra streets of value you may not have gotten if you bet yourself.\n\n2.

DRAWING HANDS\nWe\u2019ve already discussed drawing hands; however, not all draws were created equal. Some draws are stronger and have more equity than others, so they should be played in different ways. It\u2019s essential to understand how strong your draw is before you make your decision; otherwise, you risk overplaying your hand and making a mistake.\n\nVery Strong Draws \u2013 A very strong draw often has more than one way to improve. Think of hands like an open-ended straight flush draw; these hands have nine outs to hit the flush and another four outs to make the straight, giving you thirteen outs to improve your hand by the next card. You\u2019ll hit these hands roughly 50% of the time by the river, giving you a high chance of making a great hand.\nStrong Draws \u2013 While not quite as good as a very strong draw, a strong draw still gives you decent equity against most of your opponent\u2019s range. Think of hands like flush draws and open-ended straight draws. You have 8/9 outs to improve your hand, which means you\u2019ll make your draw around \u2153 of the time by the river.\nWeak Draws \u2013 A weak draw can be one of two things: It can be a draw to a weak hand (such as the bottom end of a straight), or it can be a draw with very few outs (such as a gutshot straight draw). These hands often aren\u2019t worth playing if there\u2019s significant action, as it\u2019s either unlikely you\u2019ll make the hand, or you could make the worst hand if you do improve.\nHOW TO PLAY DRAWING HANDS\nHow you play your drawing hands will depend on what kind of draw you have, your position relative to your opponent, and how strong you think your opponent\u2019s range is. You should always consider these three factors before deciding whether to make a bet, and there\u2019s a specific order that you should consider them. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\n\nHow Strong is Your Opponent?\nThe first thing you should always consider is how strong you think your opponent\u2019s range is. If you believe your opponent has lots of strong hands on a particular flop, you\u2019ll want to bluff with your draws less often and try to make them as cheaply as possible. However, suppose you think your opponent is weak on a specific flop. In that case, you should bet your draws aggressively, as it\u2019s more likely your opponent will fold, and you\u2019ll win the pot.\n\nHow Strong is Your Draw?\nThe next thing to consider is how strong your draw is. The stronger the draw, the more equity you\u2019ll have against your opponent\u2019s range (even if they have a strong range), which means you can bet more aggressively. Bluffing aggressively on the flop is great if you\u2019ve got a draw like an open-ended straight flush draw but is riskier if you\u2019ve got a weak draw like a gutshot.\n\nTherefore, you should always consider how strong your draw is against your opponent\u2019s range. You should bluff your weaker draws less frequently if your opponent has a strong range.\n\nWhat\u2019s Your Position?\nThe last thing you need to consider is your relative position at the table. When you\u2019re in position, you can control the pot more effectively and keep the pot small when you want to make your draw. However, when you\u2019re out of position, there\u2019s always a chance your opponent will raise, so you need to be prepared for that.\n\nSo, again, we should consider the other two factors before deciding. For example, suppose we\u2019re out of position with a weak-medium draw against an opponent with a strong range. In that case, we\u2019re better off checking rather than betting. If we bet, our opponent could raise, blowing us off our equity, but if we check, we give ourselves the option to just call their bet, allowing us to draw more cheaply.\n\n3. UNMADE HANDS\nUnmade hands are the worst of the bunch. These are hands that haven\u2019t flopped a pair or any meaningful draw and, in essence, are absolute garbage.", "start_char_idx": 7460, "end_char_idx": 11929, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd7f59d9-716e-4c0e-a48d-7d9242b25bac": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd7f59d9-716e-4c0e-a48d-7d9242b25bac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58552be-07ba-4c3c-9860-287cec9e7a37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3c7263204fff448f9b4bf79bdf074a8a7375d5db25626bdcbaba8c1d082bfeee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30a880b9-042a-45e5-b15f-4ff15b88e741", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "31f07123f305afe63bee1811c36435a1260122d6c86c91c00cb0d53c0ccf26f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5974472c-ded4-4814-b6fc-fd3ead4e3d42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ed821701b1a5fc4a4a34a9d46b05a37275c5e1d0c2e97221bdd9fd43160860ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "When you\u2019re in position, you can control the pot more effectively and keep the pot small when you want to make your draw.

If we bet, our opponent could raise, blowing us off our equity, but if we check, we give ourselves the option to just call their bet, allowing us to draw more cheaply.\n\n3. UNMADE HANDS\nUnmade hands are the worst of the bunch. These are hands that haven\u2019t flopped a pair or any meaningful draw and, in essence, are absolute garbage. Think of a hand like 8\u2764\ufe0f7\u2764\ufe0f on a flop of A\u2660K\u2660J\u2663; there\u2019s absolutely nothing going for it. Picking the unmade hands to bluff with on the flop is an important skill.\n\nIn these situations, you have two options. You can either give up, check the hand, and fold it to any aggression, or you can bluff at it.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to strike a balance between giving up and bluffing. If you bluff too often, your opponent will always call you down. If you never bluff, your opponent will never call you. Picking the unmade hands to bluff with on the flop is an important skill, and there are things that you should look for in your unmade hands that make them more attractive bluffing candidates.\n\nCONTINUATION BETTING WHEN YOU MISS THE FLOP\nOvercards\nIf your unmade hand has an overcard to the flop, this makes it a decent bluffing candidate. Why? Because if you get lucky, you can make top pair on the turn or river, which sometimes gives you the best hand! When bluffing, it\u2019s always better to give yourself a chance to make the best hand, even if it\u2019s slim. Bluffing with the possibility of making top pair is far better than bluffing with low cards, where the best you can make is 2nd or 3rd pair.\n\nBackdoor Draws\nIf you do have low cards, that doesn\u2019t mean you should never bluff with them. Some of these low cards have \u201cbackdoor draws,\u201d which means that if you catch running cards on the turn and river, you can make a strong hand like a straight or a flush.\n\nFor example, if you have 7\u2764\ufe0f6\u2764\ufe0f on a board of A\u2764\ufe0fK\u2663Q\u2660, you have three cards to a flush. If you bluff on the flop and a heart comes on the turn, you\u2019ve upgraded your hand to a bonafide flush draw! If you bluff again on the turn, there\u2019s a chance that if you\u2019re called, another heart will come on the river, giving you what\u2019s likely to be the best hand.\n\nKnowing what hands you should or shouldn\u2019t be bluffing with isn\u2019t the only thing you need to know when c-betting with an unmade hand. When considering whether or not to bet your draws, you need to consider the hands your opponent can have in their range.\n\nThe stronger your opponent\u2019s range is, the less often you should bluff, as it will work less often! On the other hand, if you think your opponent\u2019s range is particularly weak, you should up your bluffing frequency, as it\u2019s more likely to work.\n\nHand reading can be tough, but it\u2019s essential for knowing what hands your opponent is likely to have in any given situation. If you want to better understand poker ranges and how they work, you should read our article on poker ranges.\n\nBETTING ON THE FLOP\nKnowing when to bet on the flop can be complicated, as there are many things you must consider before making your decision. However, knowing why you should or shouldn\u2019t bet makes it easier to identify what you should do with your hand. Let\u2019s look at what those reasons are.\n\nWHY BET:\nMaximize Value \u2013 When you make a bet, you decide how much money goes into the pot. When you\u2019re value betting, having this control over the hand is vital because you want to maximize every chip you can extract from your opponent. If you check, hoping to trap, your opponent may check back, or they may bet a smaller amount than you were hoping for.\nBluff \u2013 You\u2019d also want to bet to bluff your opponent off a stronger hand.", "start_char_idx": 11112, "end_char_idx": 15197, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5974472c-ded4-4814-b6fc-fd3ead4e3d42": {"__data__": {"id_": "5974472c-ded4-4814-b6fc-fd3ead4e3d42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58552be-07ba-4c3c-9860-287cec9e7a37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3c7263204fff448f9b4bf79bdf074a8a7375d5db25626bdcbaba8c1d082bfeee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bd7f59d9-716e-4c0e-a48d-7d9242b25bac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "2265b8daee0255f3194797a3dd6c3e370e90bfb6ad417363f9859b6952a55d1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d363c3d6-8f5d-426d-8766-38be54167225", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36ffcd76850f8f7c840431ef9d51a45b7f12d8cf3cc4fbf81e77a05bd5dcc7a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If you want to better understand poker ranges and how they work, you should read our article on poker ranges.\n\nBETTING ON THE FLOP\nKnowing when to bet on the flop can be complicated, as there are many things you must consider before making your decision. However, knowing why you should or shouldn\u2019t bet makes it easier to identify what you should do with your hand. Let\u2019s look at what those reasons are.\n\nWHY BET:\nMaximize Value \u2013 When you make a bet, you decide how much money goes into the pot. When you\u2019re value betting, having this control over the hand is vital because you want to maximize every chip you can extract from your opponent. If you check, hoping to trap, your opponent may check back, or they may bet a smaller amount than you were hoping for.\nBluff \u2013 You\u2019d also want to bet to bluff your opponent off a stronger hand. You can\u2019t get your opponent to fold if you check, so if you ever want to win with a bad hand, you need to be able to bet as a bluff. Similarly to when you\u2019re value betting, if you\u2019re in control of the betting action, you get to decide how much it will take for your opponent to call. You can tailor your bet size to get your opponent to fold different parts of their range.\nProtection \u2013 Protection is an interesting concept in poker, as, technically, it\u2019s a type of value bet. Still, it\u2019s one where you hope not to get called most of the time. A protection bet aims to get your opponent to fold a hand with a good amount of equity against your hand. For example, if you have a hand like bottom pair on the flop, getting your opponent to fold two overcards is a good result, as that hand has a good chance of beating ours if we check back. However, protection bets can only be made with made hands, and there are times when our opponent will call with worse, making them a kind of value bet.\nWHY NOT TO BET:\nPot Control \u2013 You may want to avoid betting to control the pot size. If you have a marginal made hand or a draw against an opponent with a strong range, keeping the pot small by checking is often the best play. When we\u2019re in these marginal situations, we don\u2019t want to inflate the size of the pot by betting. Instead, we want to realize as much of our equity as possible as cheaply as possible. The best way to do that is by checking.\nSlowplay \u2013 Another reason we may not want to bet is that we may want to bait our opponent into betting for us. While this gives up control of the betting action, it can sometimes be the most profitable play to make, as it gives us a chance to check-raise and further increase the size of the pot. However, you must be mindful of the type of opponent you\u2019re playing against before you slowplay. Suppose you\u2019re playing against an aggressive player. In that case, slowplaying can be a profitable play. Still, if you\u2019re playing against a passive player, you\u2019re better off betting yourself.\nBy running your hand through each possible reason for betting or not betting, you should have a clearer idea of how your hand should be played. Check out our in-depth guide to betting for more info.\n\nTHE FLOP: COMMON SITUATIONS\nHere are some situations you could find yourself in and how to play the round.\n\n1. PAIR, MIDDLE POCKET PAIR, TOP PAIR WITH LOW KICKER\nIf you\u2019re holding on to one of these combos, you should bet out if there is no action before you. If you are called, it\u2019s worth seeing what the card shows on the turn. If you are raised, the safest play would be to fold with these cards. However, if it\u2019s a standard raise, it\u2019s worth considering calling with top pair. In most cases, fold any other combos.\n\n2. OVERPAIR, TWO PAIR, TOP PAIR WITH TOP KICKER\nIf you have one of these hands, you\u2019re in an excellent position, so you should raise. But you want to avoid offering your opponent correct pot odds to draw, so make a sizable bet. Remember: You want to avoid giving your opponents a chance to catch the next card. If you slowplay, your hand could become weaker.\n\n3. SET, STRAIGHT, FLUSH\nIf you find yourself holding one of these hands, you\u2019re in a fantastic position. In this situation, you want to bet out in a bid to get as much money into the pot as possible since you have a good chance of scooping a sizable pot. You could slow play here, but it\u2019s better to go for pot size.", "start_char_idx": 14360, "end_char_idx": 18622, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d363c3d6-8f5d-426d-8766-38be54167225": {"__data__": {"id_": "d363c3d6-8f5d-426d-8766-38be54167225", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58552be-07ba-4c3c-9860-287cec9e7a37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3c7263204fff448f9b4bf79bdf074a8a7375d5db25626bdcbaba8c1d082bfeee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5974472c-ded4-4814-b6fc-fd3ead4e3d42", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "fda9681126490c07ef9e889e2d1b5af050f3108c0bdcf3d493d57b15e1807abf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ae0223a0-fdc0-44bb-b427-7327ca20c14d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d873b36d0aa3d56402878fddda1e10b832c76819ece82360cd7158dcd2f7bb38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In most cases, fold any other combos.\n\n2.

In this situation, you want to bet out in a bid to get as much money into the pot as possible since you have a good chance of scooping a sizable pot. You could slow play here, but it\u2019s better to go for pot size. If you have a weak flush, you should still bet to take advantage of those looking to call with on a bigger draw.\n\n4. FULL HOUSE, FOUR OF A KIND, STRAIGHT FLUSH\nIf you\u2019re holding one of these hands, then you\u2019re surely in a winning position. However, these hands come along infrequently, so you want to take full advantage. Consider slowplaying and allow other cards to come out. You want to increase the pot size to its maximum potential. If you only take a small pot with a strong hand like this, it\u2019s almost a waste.\n\nFLOP STRATEGY TIPS\nThere\u2019s plenty to think about when the flop comes down. First and foremost, you should always have your opponents in mind and consider what hands they could hold. This means taking note of their action on the flop and assuming your opponent has a drawing hand.\n\nYou should never get attached to your good hands either; if your opponent shows a lot of strength, you must let the good hands go. Furthermore, it all comes down to reading the situation and playing smart. Don\u2019t rely on luck.\n\nGIVE YOUR OPPONENT THE WRONG POT ODDS\nWhen making decisions on the flop, consider using conventional poker strategy against your opponents by giving them incorrect odds to call with a draw. For example, on wet, draw-heavy flops like J\u266310\u26638\u26607\u26608\u266010\u2764\ufe0f etc., it\u2019s better to use a large sizing with your strong hands, as it gives your opponents the wrong odds to call.\n\nFor example, if the pot on the flop is $10, it\u2019s perfectly fine to use full pot sizing on draw-heavy boards. If your opponent has to call $10 into a $10 pot, they\u2019re getting immediate odds of 2-1, meaning they have to make their hand 1 in 3 times (33%) for it to be a profitable call. However, if they have a hand like a flush draw or a straight draw, they\u2019ll only make their hand around 20% of the time.\n\nThis means that if they call, they\u2019re making a mathematical mistake, and you\u2019re making money with your bet.\n\nALWAYS CONSIDER YOUR OPPONENT\nAfter the flop comes down and you can see a five-card hand, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in your own and not consider what your opponent has. However, deciding the best strategy for your hand cannot be done in a vacuum. Having an idea of the range of hands your opponent can have will allow you to make the best decision.\n\nFor example, if your opponent will not continue against a bet, you may want to check your strong hand instead of blindly betting it for value. You also need to consider the type of opponent they are \u2013 are they tight or loose, passive or aggressive? Knowing these traits will help you better understand what hands your opponent is likely to have in any given situation.\n\nTHINK ABOUT HANDS IN RANGES\nMany beginner players try to put their opponent on one single hand and then play as if their opponent has that hand. In reality, that is a very tough thing to do, as players will often play a variety of hands in the exact same way. This is why you need to consider ranges and all the hands your opponent can have, given how the hand has played out.\n\nIf you think your opponent has one specific hand, but they don\u2019t, it could lead to you making catastrophic errors in how you play your hand. However, by thinking in terms of ranges, you are more likely to make the overall right decision.\n\nDON\u2019T BE AFRAID TO FOLD\nSometimes in poker, you just have to let good hands go. When your opponent displays a lot of strength, you need to pay attention and continue with the very best hands you have in your range. Deceptively middling hands like TPTK or an overpair sometimes need to be folded on the flop if the board is wet.", "start_char_idx": 17907, "end_char_idx": 22195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae0223a0-fdc0-44bb-b427-7327ca20c14d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae0223a0-fdc0-44bb-b427-7327ca20c14d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f58552be-07ba-4c3c-9860-287cec9e7a37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "3c7263204fff448f9b4bf79bdf074a8a7375d5db25626bdcbaba8c1d082bfeee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d363c3d6-8f5d-426d-8766-38be54167225", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "data/postflop_guide3.txt", "file_name": "postflop_guide3.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 23077, "creation_date": "2024-04-09", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-09"}, "hash": "78080a74a7ea6fc96389643c74ab3441cc59394a14bf5f1c9c07d364fc94318a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In reality, that is a very tough thing to do, as players will often play a variety of hands in the exact same way.
